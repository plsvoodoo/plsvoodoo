# Voodoo Meme Coin

Welcome to the Voodoo Meme Coin project! 

## Introduction
Voodoo is a decentralized meme coin built on the PulseChain network. Our mission is to provide a fun and engaging platform for meme enthusiasts while leveraging the power and security of blockchain technology.

## Smart Contract
The Voodoo Meme Coin smart contract can be found at the following address on the PulseChain network: 0x1c5f8e8E84AcC71650F7a627cfA5B24B80f44f00. Users can interact with the smart contract by using its address on PulseChain-compatible wallets or through dApps built on the PulseChain network

## Tokenomics
- **Liquidity Pool (2%):** Voodoo allocates 2% to the liquidity pool, ensuring easy trading, stability, and a reliable backup fund for seamless transactions.
- **Marketing & Buyback (5%):** To drive adoption and long-term success, 5% of Voodoo tokens are allocated to marketing, buyback, and growth initiatives, benefiting our community and investors.
- **Burn Events (5%):** Through burn events, we allocate 5% to remove tokens from circulation, reducing supply and increasing scarcity in the Voodoo token.
- **Total Supply:** The total supply of Voodoo tokens will be fixed at a specific amount (e.g., 21 million), ensuring scarcity and value appreciation over time. This controlled supply creates a sense of exclusivity and rarity that contributes to the token's long-term value.

## Features
- **Decentralized:** Voodoo operates on the PulseChain network, ensuring transparency, security, and trust through decentralized consensus.
- **Meme Coin Ecosystem:** Join a vibrant community of meme lovers, where you can create, share, and trade memes using Voodoo tokens.
